# Chaotic Dynamics Java Applet
This is a repository to store the source code for Java applets I created during undergrad to study chaotic dynamical systems. They were originally developed to study the complex polynomial map $F_n(z)=z^n+ncz$ where $c$ is a complex parameter and $n\ge3$ is an integer. It is part of the larger [Dynamical Systems and Technology Project](https://math.bu.edu/DYSYS/index.html) at Boston University.
